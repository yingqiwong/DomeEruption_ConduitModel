DomeEruption_ConduitModel
==========================

Updated 29 January 2021

1-dimensional steady-state and time-dependent conduit flow models 
for lava dome eruptions, specialized for Mount St. Helens 2004-2008 
eruption. Details on each part of the model are given in the two papers
(Wong et al., 2017; Wong and Segall, 2019) in the Publications folder.

Examples to run the model is given in Code/RunModelScripts/.
You can either run the steady-state model only, 
or the full time-dependent model.

This repo is still a work in progress. I will be cleaning things up
and adding more scripts in time.
