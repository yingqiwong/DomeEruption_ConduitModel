DomeEruption_ConduitModel
==========================

Updated November 20, 2019

1-dimensional steady-state and time-dependent conduit flow models 
for lava dome eruptions, specialized for Mount St. Helens 2004-2008 
eruption. Details on each part of the model are given in the two papers
(Wong et al., 2017; Wong and Segall, 2019) in the Publications folder.

An example to run the model is given in Code/Scripts/RunModel.m

This repo is still a work in progress. I will cleaning things up
and adding more scripts in time.
